#### Why?
One day In March my children came to me and said that they were going to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day and were looking for green clothes. They also showed infographics (below).  
After that I thought "Why we don't celebrate JavaScript Developers day?". I have been working with JS for over 10 years like thousands of others JS developers around the world. But we have never celebrated it.  
So let's fix it!

## If you want to hold and orginize the JavaScript Pub Quiz in your city
Since this year we will not have time to organize a carnival :smile:, so I propose to prepare JS Pub Quiz which can be used in different locations on the same day.  
**Description/Rules** https://github.com/js-day/js-day/blob/master/js-dev-day-pub-quiz.md  
**Why this format** It allows to organize participants, facilitates the conversion of [colleagues into friends](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness)
